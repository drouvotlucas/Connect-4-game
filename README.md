# Connect 4 Game with AI

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Connect 4 game, featuring an AI opponent that uses the MinMax algorithm. The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook and includes the following components:

Introduction:
Connect 4 is a classic two-player game where the objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. This project implements the game with an AI opponent that uses the MinMax algorithm to make decisions. The AI is trained using a neural network model, and the training process is detailed in the notebook.

Features:
* Game Implementation: A fully functional Connect 4 game with a 6x7 grid.
* AI Opponent: An AI that uses the MinMax algorithm to play against a human or another AI.
* Neural Network Model: A neural network model is used to train the AI, with options for reinforcement learning.
* Training Process: The notebook includes a detailed training process where the AI learns from playing multiple games against itself or another opponent.
